# Neovim Configuration

This repo contains my neovim settings/config. It's loosely based on the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/master) template, but with some additions and split up into a more modular form.

To install, run the commands 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make gcc ripgrep unzip git xclip neovim
```
then move the contents of this file into the folder `~/.config/nvim/*`.
